                My name is Eyetu Kingsley. I specialize in crafting beautiful, responsive and interactive websites with Search Engine Optimization in mind, and in line with best practices. I am also capable of developing the logic and functionality of a website, be it for an ecommerce store, inventory management platform, or a custom solution.

                I started my software development journey over 2 years ago with Python. Since then, I've learnt new tools and languages to get the job done while delivering the very best I can. To give back to the community, I also develop talents by training students on frontend development in my free time.

                When it comes to design, my main tools are Figma, HTML, TailwindCSS, and Vue.js.  When it comes to the development of server-side code, I mainly use Django, Python and MySQL (Or any other SQL database). I have also edited purchased templates for companies, per their request. I have deep passion for my line of work and I would like to work with you.
