                I'm Eyetu Kingsley, a fullstack developer with an experience in frontend and backend languages, frameworks and tools. I have also worked with designers to convert Figma designs into responsive and interactive web pages. In addition, I am capable of editing templates and pre-existing webpages.

                I started my software development journey over 2 years ago with Python. Since then, I've learnt new tools and languages to get the job done while delivering the very best I can. To give back to the community, I also develop talents by training students on frontend development in my free time.

                I have worked as a freelancer and as a full-time employee with TraterDev and PythonBay as a Frontend Developer and Pythonista. I create most my designs using Figma or on-the-fly when the need arises, and sometimes acquire and edit templates if deemed necessary. I have deep passion for my line of work.
